{"id":"chord-visualizer","name":"Chord Visualizer","rating":4.5,"category":["Music Software"],"description":"Chord Visualizer is a web app designed to help musicians and music enthusiasts learn chords through an interactive and engaging experience. The app features a real-time chord visualizer that syncs seamlessly with audio sources like YouTube videos, providing a dynamic way to follow along with music. Users can see chords displayed as they play, enhancing their learning experience by combining visual cues with auditory input. Whether you're practicing a song or learning new chords, Chord Visualizer makes the process intuitive and fun.","smImage":"/assets/project/chord-visualizer.png","url":"https://saacostam.github.io/fuzzy-noteable/","iframe":{"isResponsive":true},"repoUrl":"https://github.com/saacostam/fuzzy-noteable","content":[{"type":"header","text":"Key Features"},{"type":"ul","listElements":["Key and Capo Adjustment: Users can change the key or move the capo on a guitar, with chords automatically shifting based on the key.","Chord Display: Shows the previous, current, and next chords, allowing users to \"get ready\" for upcoming chords, especially useful for unfamiliar chords.","Chord Variations: Offers a relatively wide range of chord variations, covering many common chords.","Chord Duration Progress Bar: Displays a progress bar for each chord, indicating how long it should be played, which is helpful for songs with variable chord durations.","YouTube Playback Sync: Adapts to changes in playback position and speed on YouTube, allowing for flexible learning at different speeds."]},{"type":"header","text":"Challanges and Solutions"},{"type":"text","text":"Syncing the visualizer with an audio source was the main challange from the project.

By using familiar DAW-like concepts, TuneCode enables users to create and manipulate music directly through code. It allows the playback of melodies using basic oscillators, the scheduling of audio samples, and the application of effects to craft rich soundscapes. TuneCode bridges the gap between music production and coding, offering a new, flexible way to explore musical creativity.","category":["Music Software"],"smImage":"/assets/project/tune-code.png"},{"id":"3d-music-visualizer","name":"3D Music Visualizer","rating":4,"description":"3D Music Visualizer is a web application that generates attractive 3D visualizations of audio files, using the AnalyserNode from the JavaScript Audio API combined with p5.js and WEBGL for rendering. Users can upload their own audio tracks, customize various visual parameters, and select from different visualization modes to create a personalized experience.
